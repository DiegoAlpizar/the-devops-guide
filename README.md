# Welcome to The DevOps Guide :wave

It is an open-source guide to provide you with an outline of skills needed to learn to get into DevOps. At the end of it you should have the technical knowledge of DevOps.

## Prerequisite

- Linux
- Networking
- Programming Fundamentals (Python)
I highly recommend some fundamental knowledge of Linux, Networking and Programming.
Maybe we will add these as pre-phases to this guide but for now, checkout [Learn to Cloud Guide](https://learntocloud.guide) as it has some great resources and projects for these prerequisites.

## How this Guide works

We have sections/phases which covers fundamentals of DevOps:

- Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)
- Version Control System (VCS)
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Configuration Management
- Containerization
- Monitoring/Observability

But first, let's understand what DevOps is?
